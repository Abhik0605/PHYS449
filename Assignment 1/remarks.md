# Remarks


## Grading Remarks
- Missing constant term for linear regression (-3)
- Gradient descent should use entire dataset for an average gradient (-1)

## Other Remarks
- Comments can be more detailed
- Class implemented with little utility (not necessary for this assignment)
-- For additional utility you may want to save weights and implement a call for the model
